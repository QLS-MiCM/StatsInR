# QLS-MiCM Statistics in R Workshop

This workshop provides a brief introduction to key concepts for statistical analysis in R. We will start by presenting key features of the dplyr package in R â€“ this will include data frame filtering, variable manipulation, merging of data frames, and handling of missing data. Subsequently, we will delve into two classic statistical models: the linear regression model and the logistic regression model. We will analyze the assumptions underlying each model and explore their limitations. Finally, we will explore statistical testing and experimental design concepts.
